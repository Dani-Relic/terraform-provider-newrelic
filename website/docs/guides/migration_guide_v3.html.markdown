  Use this guide to update the New Relic Terraform Provider from v2.x to v3.x

## Upgrade to v3.x of the New Relic Terraform Provider

Version 3.x of the provider uses a new underlying API for Synthetics. This results in some changes that will need to be made to existing Synthetics resource to keep them compatible with the new API.

### Migrating script Synthetics monitor resources

The previous `newrelic_synthetics_monitor_resourece` has been split into two new resources: `newrelic_synthetics_monitor_resource` and `newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor_resource`. Previously a monitor script had to be defined separately from a Synthetics Monitor using the `newrelic_synthetics_monitor_script_resource`. In this new version a script is attached directly to a scripted monitor. See the below example for how to migrate to version 3:

Previous  
```hcl
resource "newrelic_synthetics_monitor" "monitor" {
  name      = "monitor-name"
  type      = "SCRIPT_BROWSER"
  frequency = 1
  status    = "DISABLED"
  locations = ["AWS_US_EAST_1"]
  uri       = "https://google.com"
}
resource "newrelic_synthetics_monitor_script" "monitor_script" {
  monitor_id = newrelic_synthetics_monitor.monitor.id
  text       = "console.log("hello, world")"
	location {
		name = "AWS_US_EAST_1"
	}
}
```

Current
```hcl
resource "newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor" "monitor" {
  name	          =	"monitor-name"
  type	          =	"SCRIPT_API"
 	location_public	=	["US_EAST_1"]
 	period	        =	"EVERY_HOUR"
 	status	        =	"ENABLED"
 	script	        =	"console.log("hello, world")"
 	tag {
 		key	          =	"some_key"
 		values	      =	["some_value"]
 	}
}
```

#### Steps to migrate to new resource

1. Move the value in `text` from `newrelic_synthetics_monitor_script` to `script` in `newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor`
2. Remove `AWS_` from the location name, e.g. `AWS_US_EAST_1` becomes `US_EAST_1`

### Migrating script Synthetics monitor resources with VSE

In v3.x of the provider, we have introduced a new resource `newrelic_synthetics_private_location` for creating a private location to attach to a monitor. Previously, an HMAC for a private location had to be calculated for a monitor script to run in a private location. See the below example for how to migrate to version 3:

Previous  
```hcl
resource "newrelic_synthetics_monitor" "foo" {
  name      = "monitor-name"
  type      = "SCRIPT_BROWSER"
  frequency = 1
  status    = "DISABLED"
  locations = ["AWS_US_EAST_1"]
  uri       = "https://google.com"
}

resource "newrelic_synthetics_monitor_script" "foo_script" {
  monitor_id = newrelic_synthetics_monitor.foo.id
  text       = "console.log('hello, world')"
  location {
    name         = "private-location"
    vse_password = "secret"
  }
}
```

Current
```hcl
resource "newrelic_synthetics_private_location" "private_location" {
  description               = "Test Private Location"
  name                      = "test-private-location"
  verified_script_execution = true
}

resource "newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor" "monitor" {
  location_private {
    guid         = newrelic_synthetics_private_location.private_location.id
    vse_password = secret
  }
  name                 = "test-monitor"
  period               = "EVERY_HOUR"
  runtime_type_version = ""
  runtime_type         = ""
  script_language      = ""
  status               = "ENABLED"
  type                 = "SCRIPT_BROWSER"
  script               = "console.log('hello, world')"
  tag {
    key    = "some_key"
    values = ["some_value"]
  }
}
```

#### Steps to migrate to new resource

1. Follow the guide above to migrate to the new `newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor` resource
2. Create or import a private location using the `newrelic_synthetics_private_location` resource
3. Add a `location_private` block to the `newrelic_synthetics_script_monitor` resource with the `guid` of the private location and the `vse_password`
